32 Shades of Grey - NTSC Grayscale generator

This project implements a low cost portable NTSC video pattern generator for testing monochrome video systems regarding gain and resolution. 
The circuit provides a video output with voltage and impedance according with the RS-170 standard. 
A CR2025 coin cell powers the circuit that it is automatically activated when the output plug is connected.
